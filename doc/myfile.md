:::{note}
And here's a note with a colon fence!
:::

```{admonition} Here's my title
:class: warning

Here's my admonition content
```
(section-two)=
## Section Two big 2

And some more content.

```commandline
:optionname: <valuename>

<directive content>

```
{ref}`My displayed text <my-ref>`

(label-name)=
## Some header

And here's {ref}`a reference to this section <section-two>`.
I can also reference the section {ref}`section-two` without specifying my title.
